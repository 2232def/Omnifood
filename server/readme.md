    1. Create a Gmail account if you donâ€™t have one: [Gmail Sign Up](https://www.gmail.com).
    2. Use an App-Specific Password if you have 2FA enabled.
    3. https://myaccount.google.com/security 
       -> In the search for app password
       -> Choose app password (security)
       -> Generate your password there
    4. Your email will be the address you used to sign up (e.g., `youremail@gmail.com`).
    5. The password is your Gmail account password or the App-Specific Password.
